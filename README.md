# DSAN Unscramble Computer Science Problems

## Overview
This is the first project part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree at Udacity, intended to test problem solving skills.

The project consists in completing five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and text exchanged during September 2016. It uses Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset and then performs a run time analysis of solution to determine the efficiency.

The specific instructions are included in the task files.

## Project rubric
Code Quality

Your code should be well-structured and readable.

Output

Print only the solution outputs. Feel free to use other print statements during the development process, but remember to remove them for submission.

Task 0 Successful

Task 0 - The script correctly prints out the information of first record of texts and last record of calls.

Task 1 Successful

Task 1 - The script correctly prints number of distinct telephone numbers in the dataset.

Task 2 Successful

Task 2 - The script correctly prints the telephone number that spent the longest time on the phone and the total time in seconds they spend on phone call.

Task 3 Successful

Task 3 - The script correctly prints the telephone codes called by fixed-line numbers in Bangalore and the percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore that are to fixed lines in Bangalore.

Task 4 Successful

Task 4 - The script correctly prints the list of numbers that could be telemarketers.

Time - Complexity

Student provides a text file accurately explaining their run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) for each solution they produced.
